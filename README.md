# Lord of The Rings

This is a text adventure game exploring the land of Middle-Earth. 

## Gameplay
(Warning: this game is non-canon) It begins in about SA 1500, when Sauron instructs the forging of the Rings of Power. The game is riddled with secrets and references to the traditional and nontraditional Middle-Earth fiction. It follows the plots of the dark-wizard, FairÃ»man, who would later become the embodiment of Sauron, and his corrupt dragon,  Ulthmath, who is encountered in volume 2 in the rubble of Minas Tirith. You become an assassin in the Gondorian army after escaping the lair of a goblin warlord, and then are sent on countless missions to destroy powerful foes.

## Difficulty
This is planed to be at first, a relatively easy game, and then its difficulty progresses according to the gameplay.

## Location
If it took place in the third age, the adventure would begin along the river labeled Ciril, the Goblin Warlord's lair being found in the Ephel Duath, being found about halfway inbetween the Crossings of Poros and the Sea of Nurnen.
