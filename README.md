# Lord of The Rings

This is a text adventure game exploring the land of Middle-Earth. 
## Gameplay
It begins in about SA 1500, when Sauron instructs the forging of the Rings of Power. The game is riddled with secerets and references to the traditional and untraditional Midle-Earth fiction. It follows the plots of the dark-wizard, FairÃ»man, who would later become the embodyment of Sauron (Warning: this information is non-canon). You become an assasin in the Gondorian army after escaping the lair of a goblin warlord, and then are sent on countless missions to destroy powerfuull foes.

## Difficulty
This is planed to be at first, a relativley easy game, and then its difficulty progresses acording to the gameplay.

## Location
If it took place in the third age, the adventure would begin along the river labeled Ciril, the Goblin Warlord's lair being found in the Ephel Duath, being found about halfway inbetween the Crossings of Poros and the Sea of Nurnen.
