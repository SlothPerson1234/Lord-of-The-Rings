# Lord of the Rings: Before the Rings

This is a text adventure game exploring the land of Middle-Earth. Unfortunately, i do not realy know when I will have time to work on this again

## Machine Requirements
Have a Mac or an installed ruby version > 2.0
run this in your terminal/powershell/commandline (for mac it's Terminal.app in your applications folder)

## Gameplay
(Warning: this game is non-canon, and any invention of maya, other charecters, and secret assasin guilds should be disclosed as the imagination of me, and ultimitly completley dumb in the light of other tolkein lore) It begins in about SA 1500, when Sauron instructs the forging of the Rings of Power. The game is riddled with secrets and references to the traditional and nontraditional Middle-Earth fiction. It follows the plots of the dark-wizard, FairÃ»man, a maya of Morgath, who would later become a servent of Sauron, (and eventualy killed before the begining of the war of the Rings,) and the corrupt dragon,  Ulthmath, who is encountered in volume 2 in the rubble of Minas Tirith. You become an assassin in the Gondorian army after escaping the lair of a goblin warlord, and then are sent on countless missions to destroy powerful foes. Advanced class, weapon, attack, location, and shopping systems are in place, but not uite implemented into the gameplay. 28 basic often used stats are in place, but are not quite imlemented fully.

## Difficulty
This is planed to be at first, a relatively easy game, and then its difficulty progresses according to the gameplay. This game would be ok for beging players, for it is planed to have a difficulty that rises slowly, and ocasionaly drops back down.

## Location
If it took place in the third age, the adventure would begin along the river Anduin, the Goblin Warlord's lair being found in the Ephel Duath, about halfway inbetween the Crossings of Poros and the Sea of Nurnen.


## Code
This project is written in basic ruby, with some moderatly advanced systems, and some overly complicated ones that have been yet to be implimented. Doing stuff in ruby is a pain if you dont want basic options.
I'm focusing on learning other code languages currently and I just dont have enough man power or time to do both, so this will probably continue to be incomplete.

## Major Updates

| Update | Info |

| 1, Boromir | Volume 2 complete, asests added, along with this table. |

### Please Enjoy this Game, and remember:
>Not all those who wander are lost*
 *this was kindof just a line in a song. Its been over-comercialized.
